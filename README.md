<p>
Developed as part of the Android Nanodegree Programme, Movies is an Android App to get the latest and greatest movies using Movie-DB API.
It also allows users to create a personal movies library, get trailers, reviews, ratings, descriptions and more about different movies.</p>
<b> Please Note </b>
<br>
The movie-db API key is to be assigned to the apiKey variable in the MainActivity.java file, Line number 28 for the project to work
Thank You.
